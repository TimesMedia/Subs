Foreword

The MIMS Handbook of General Medicine – Volume 1 enters the picture when the disputing forces of
biotechnology and artificial intelligence brought about by the fourth industrial revolution are poised
radically to impact both health and healthcare, and change the daily practice of medicine. Electronic
patient records, wearable diagnostic devices and continuous health monitoring, as well as the appli-
cation of big data, algorithms and predictive modelling, will certainly not replace the doctor, but will
help to serve communities and patients better. Consequently, it is important for MIMS to embrace and
to explore these changes in our reference information as part of our quest to help keep our subscribers
abreast of innovations.
  The articles in this publication, contributed by medical experts, cover an array of disciplines and topics
and aim to guide and update clinical decision-making and stimulate discussion. The focus is on health
challenges, including the role of the patient as a partner in healthcare in line with a patient/person-cen-
tred approach to care that is now in the forefront of change. The challenges posed by the contribution
of lifestyle and an ageing population to the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and asso-
ciated end-organ damage are covered comprehensively with new updates. The importance of com-
municable diseases relevant to South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa during an era when travel across
borders for business or leisure purposes has increased, places the focus clearly on those infections that
may not always be top-of-mind. The Handbook also covers frequently seen diseases and conditions to
assist in their management, and to keep patients and their families appropriately informed.
  A huge vote of thanks goes to each and every author featured in this handbook, who took time out
of his or her busy professional schedule to contribute. I believe their commitment to serving their peers in
order to better serve the patient community is evident in the high quality of their review articles.
  Both MIMS and I want to thank you, the clinician, for continuously serving the people of this beautiful
country and hope that this publication will contribute towards your ability to do so. I trust that you will
enjoy what is offered and would like to invite anyone with constructive input to contact me via MIMS so
that we can enhance future publications to better serve your professional needs.

How to use this publication

MIMS Handbook of General Medicine – Volume 1 comprises two main editorial sections.

Section 1: Treatment Approaches

These up-to-date, research-based review articles aim to inform the medical practitioner about the lat-
est diagnostic and treatment approaches.
  The information provided from leading academics and opinion-leader specialists in the country will
enable the doctor to continue to be in the forefront of best practice and evidenced-based clinical
care pathways.

Section 2: Drug-Class Overview

This section features a comprehensive overview of a selection of drug classes relevant to various disci-
plines in general medicine. For each specified class and sub-classification thereof, the mechanism of
action and relevant “black box”-type warnings are given. Each class features a table, structured ac-
cording to active ingredient, which highlights important aspects, such as usual dosage range, dosage
forms available on the South African market, half-life, elimination, therapeutic area according to the
registered package insert, metabolism and drug- and dose-specific warnings
  Expert pharmacology consultants compiled this section and it is essentially based on the latest avail-
able international medical information. The tables give registered indications for each product, as per
SAHPRA, and no reference is made to any “off-label” use of drugs. Off-label use may be beneficial to
the patient, but is subject to the prescribing healthcare practitioner’s judgement and expertise. The ta-
bles do not provide a comprehensive description of all the features and safety considerations of a class.
When in doubt, healthcare practitioners should consult the current manufacturer’s product literature for
registered indications and dosages, or should contact the manufacturer directly.

Important prescribing information

When prescribing any product mentioned in the MIMS Handbook of General Medicine – Volume 1,
doctors should be mindful of the important points listed below.

     	 Hypersensitivity to the ingredient(s)/components of any medicine contra-indicates its use.
     	 Medicines should not be prescribed to pregnant or lactating women unless the anticipated ben-

          efit clearly outweighs any potential risk to the foetus.
     	 The possibility of drug accumulation should be considered in the presence of significant

          renal or hepatic impairment.
     	 Tolerance to medicines is likely to be less with extremes of age.
     	 Drug interferences with laboratory tests and physical incompatibilities common with parenteral

          solutions have not been included.
     	 Mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) have a prolonged action, so patients should not take

          any of the foods or medicines known to cause reactions for at least 14 days after stopping
          treatment.
     	 Certain medicines (e.g. those that cause CNS depression) may lead to drowsiness and impaired
          concentration, which may be aggravated by the simultaneous intake of alcohol or depression
          agents.

specialists. Renal clearance is important in fibrate meta-
bolism and great care must be taken in patients with
impaired renal function. The currently available fibrates
are bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil. Gemfibrozil
should not be prescribed in combination with statins due
to a higher risk of interactions. Fenofibrate has shown in-
triguing benefits on diabetic microvascular disease in a
recent study.3 Routine addition of fenofibrate to simva-
statin in another study of diabetics with very high cardio-
vascular risk did not improve cardiovascular outcomes,
except possibly in the subgroup with the highest triglycer-
ides and lowest HDLC.4

Nicotinic acid

Nicotinic acid (or niacin) is a B-group vitamin that influ-
ences lipid metabolism in pharmacological dosages. It
decreases triglycerides, increases HDLC and modestly
lowers LDLC. Flushing is a problematic and frequent side
effect. Extended-release preparations are associated
with less flushing. Flushing is also reduced by co-admin-
istering nicotinic acid with a specific prostaglandin D2
receptor subtype 1 blocker (laropiprant).5 There is cur-
rently renewed interest in this old drug as it has multi-
ple beneficial effects on the lipid profile and newer for-
mulations are better tolerated. In a recently published,
relatively small study, niacin therapy did not improve
cardiovascular outcomes when added to intensive sta-
tin therapy and the results of a larger trial are awaited to
clarify the role of niacin in cardiovascular risk reduction.6
Although niacin can increase glucose, this is usually not
clinically problematic.7

Additional notes

The use of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3-PUFA)
may be considered in the symptomatic heart-failure
patient to reduce the risk of cardiovascular hospitalisa-
tion and death, against a background of optimal anti-
failure therapy.

  Antiplatelet therapy offers no benefit to the patient
with heart failure, in the absence of associated coro-
nary artery disease. Likewise, anticoagulation, in the ab-
sence of atrial fibrillation/flutter, and active ventricular
or atrial thrombus, has no effect in reducing morbidity
and mortality, compared with placebo or aspirin.

  Long-acting calcium-channel blockers, e.g. diltiazem
and verapamil, should be avoided (negatively inotrop-
ic) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection
fraction. Amlodipine is safe in patients with heart failure.
Felodipine would be a secondary alternative.

ment on its efficacy and safety.

Conclusion

RH is a common clinical problem associated with ad-
verse morbidity and mortality. Apparent treatment re-
sistance is a major issue and needs to be addressed in
the first instance. Thereafter, a detailed investigation
into the reasons for resistance to therapy may include
but should not be limited to the failure to institute life-
style changes, interfering drugs and secondary causes.
An approach to pharmacological treatment of RH is
outlined.

Patients should be informed to consult their doctors to oversee and monitor the conversion
from the old formulation (ELTROXIN) to the new formulation (ELTROXIN New Formulation).

When switching to the new formulation, thyroid function blood tests
(e.g. thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] levels) should be obtained 4 to 8 weeks after
switching to the new formulation, to ensure that the dosage is appropriate
to avoid the consequences of under- or over-treatment.4,5

Referral of the patient to a specialist is required if he/she
presents with the following conditions.
•	 Diagnostic uncertainty
•	 If, after four to six hours, the bronchospasm is not re-

    sponding to reliever medications.
•	 When the bronchospasm is associated with cardio-

    vascular collapse or has serious concomitant cardi-
    ac complications.
•	 If the bronchospasm is caused by a pulmonary em-
    bolism.
•	 When the bronchospasm is associated with other co-
    morbidities.
•	 Bronchospasm associated with impending respira-
    tory failure/respiratory arrest.
•	 Airflow obstruction associated with mental confusion.
•	 Any patient with severe airflow obstruction who de-
    teriorates despite adequate therapy.
•	 Inadequacy of support and home conditions.
•	 Cause and severity of prior exacerbations, e.g. ICU
    admission and/or intubation.

  Chronic cough is a common symptom with significant
morbidity for both sufferers and their families. Sympto-
matic control of chronic cough can be achieved in
the majority of individuals with a normal chest x-ray,
where smoking, ACE inhibitor use, and red flags have
been excluded by following a subsequent trial of em-
piric therapy targeting the main aetiological conditions
of chronic cough. A small group of patients who do not
respond will require referral for further investigation and
treatment directed at a hyper-responsive cough reflex.

Progression of COPD

Continued cigarette-smoking is the most significant fac-
tor in the progression of COPD. Exacerbations result in
further lung damage and cause further exacerbations.
Smoking cessation, prevention of exacerbations and
treatment of oesophageal reflux, if present, will limit ex-
acerbations and the progression of the disease.8,1

Physiology

Histologically, sinuses are lined with pseudostratified
columnar ciliated epithelium. They are arranged in col-
umns containing mucus-secreting goblet cells and pro-
ject cilia. These cilia are bathed in a sol and gel layer of
which the viscosity is partly determined by ion channels.
Consequently, ensuring the balance of ion and water
transport becomes important.

  Inflammatory mediators not only paralyse the cilia,
but they also alter the amount and nature of the mu-
cus being formed. The mucus becomes more viscous,
the sol phase becomes extremely thin, and the gel layer
becomes thicker, encroaching on the cilia and aggra-
vating their immobility. Normal secretory draining be-
comes impaired.

Conclusion

The most appropriate therapeutic approach for the
prophylaxis and primary management of sinusitis is the
maintenance of an efficient mucociliary transport sys-
tem, in order to:
•	 Hydrate the airways
•	 Increase the airway surface liquid depth
•	 Enhance ciliary beat frequency

  Sinusitis is a common disease that affects millions of
people annually. It is a disease that affects quality of life
and is often neglected in its diagnosis, and more impor-
tantly, in its treatment. Broadening the thinking around
the pathophysiology and understanding the role of
inflammation in the presenting symptoms, can make
treatment more effective.

  The routine use of antibiotics should be discouraged,
and initial treatment of acute sinusitis should focus on
the adjuvant management and treatment protocols.

mented so that fixation is removed, but horizontal and        stimuli are recorded at the contralateral inferior extra-
vertical eye movements can be observed. The test can-
not be done without a method of eliminating fixation.17

  Static and dynamic position testing: Static position
testing is used to observe the vestibular system response
to a change in head/body position, as compared to
the neutral head/body position. The measurements are
taken with or without fixation. The examiner considers
the presence or absence of nystagmus and/or changes
in nystagmus, as well as the patient’s subjective report
of symptom changes.14

  Dynamic position tests (e.g. Dix-Hallpike and side-
lying) look for transient nystagmus provoked by head
movements. They are the most commonly used tests
used to confirm a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal posi-
tional vertigo (BPPV).14

Video head impulse test

The video head impulse test (vHIT) assesses the integrity of
all six semi-circular canals objectively and independently
by comparing the eye-velocity response of the VOR in
relation to the head-velocity stimulus in the appropriate
plane of movement (see Figure 5). vHIT shows the pres-
ence of both overt and covert saccades should an ab-
normality be present. It uses an infrared video recording
of eye movements in response to short, brisk head turns
or impulses in the plane of the semi-circular canal.

  This allows for objective measurement of eye move-
ments, rather than subjective clinician observations.
The patient is instructed to maintain visual contact on a
stationary target during head impulses. Eye movements
are analysed to determine whether the eyes moved
in the same direction as the head during impulses and
then made a corrective refixation back to the target
(abnormal) (see Figure 6) or if eyes moved in the op-
posite direction of the head during impulses and main-
tained fixation on the target (normal).

  Results may demonstrate a problem with semi-circu-
lar canal function on the same side to which the head
was turned prior to the corrective refixation response.
This procedure is non-invasive, relatively short, and uti-
lises stimuli in the physiological range of everyday head
movement.14

Electrocochleography

Electrocochleography (ECochG) is a method for re-
cording the electrical potentials of the cochlea. EC-
ochG involves measurement of the stimulus-related
cochlear potentials (SP) – as opposed to the resting po-
tentials, and often includes measurements of the whole
nerve or compound action potential (AP) of the audi-
tory nerve (see Figure 8). The most popular applications
for ECochG include the:
•	 Diagnosis/assessment/monitoring of Ménière’s dis-

    ease/endolymphatic hydrops and the assessment/
    monitoring of treatment strategies for these disorders
•	 Enhancement of wave I of the ABR in the presence
    of hearing loss or when less than optimal recording
    conditions were used to obtain wave I.
•	 Measurement and monitoring of cochlear and audi-
    tory nerve function during surgery involving the audi-
    tory periphery.21

Table 1. Rome IV criteria or functional dyspepsia3

 B1. Functional dyspepsia*
   Diagnostic criteria
   1.	 One or more of the following:
           a.	 Bothersome postprandial fullness
           b.	 Bothersome early satiation
           c.	 Bothersome epigastric pain
           d.	 Bothersome epigastric burning
   AND
   2.	 No evidence of structural disease (including at upper endoscopy) that is likely to explain the symptoms

 B1a. Postprandial distress syndrome
   Diagnostic criteria

 Must include one or both of the following at least three days per week:
    1.	 Bothersome postprandial fullness (i.e. severe enough to impact on usual activities)
    2.	 Bothersome early satiation (i.e. severe enough to prevent finishing a regular-size meal)

 No evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease that is likely to explain the symptoms on routine investigations (including
 at upper endoscopy)
 Supportive remarks

       •	 Postprandial epigastric pain or burning, epigastric bloating, excessive belching, and nausea can also be present
       •	 Vomiting warrants consideration of another disorder
       •	 Heartburn is not a dyspeptic symptom but may often coexist
       •	 Symptoms that are relieved by evacuation of faeces or gas should generally not be considered as part of dyspepsia
 Other individual digestive symptoms or groups of symptoms, e.g. from gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and the irritable bowel
 syndrome may co-exist with PDS

 B1b. Epigastric pain syndrome
   Diagnostic criteria

 Must include at least one of the following symptoms at least one day a week:
    1.	 Bothersome epigastric pain (ie severe enough to impact on usual activities)

 AND/OR

    2.	 Bothersome epigastric burning (ie severe enough to impact on usual activities)
 No evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease that is likely to explain the symptoms on routine investigations (including
 at upper endoscopy)
 Supportive remarks

   1.	 Pain may be induced by ingestion of a meal, relieved by ingestion of a meal, or may occur while fasting

   2.	 Postprandial epigastric bloating, belching, and nausea can also be present
   3.	 Persistent vomiting likely suggests another disorder
   4.	 Heartburn is not a dyspeptic symptom, but may often co-exist
   5.	 The pain does not fulfil biliary pain criteria
   6.	 Symptoms that are relieved by evacuation of faeces or gas generally should not be considered as part of dyspepsia

3.	Prokinetics: Those patients not responding to PPI or
     H. pylori eradication therapy should be offered pro-
     kinetic therapy. In postprandial distress syndrome, a
     prokinetic is preferred (in South Africa, we are cur-
     rently limited to metoclopramide and domperidone).

4.	 Tricyclic antidepressants: Non-responders to PPI or
     H. pylori eradication therapy should be offered tri-
     cyclic antidepressant (TCA) therapy. In postprandial
     distress syndrome, second-line therapy after proki-
     netics includes administration of a tricyclic antide-
     pressant in low doses, but not a selective serotonin
     reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

5.	Psychological therapy: FD patients not responding
     to drug therapy should be offered psychological
     therapies.

  Patients with continued symptoms of dyspepsia de-
spite a trial of a tricyclic antidepressant and prokinetic
should undergo endoscopic evaluation with an upper
endoscopy and biopsies, if not previously performed.
Further evaluation for an alternate diagnosis should be
performed selectively, based on the patient’s symp-
toms. Patients with continued symptoms of dyspepsia
for three months with symptom onset at least six months
before diagnosis and no evidence of structural disease
to explain the symptoms, should be diagnosed and
treated as having functional dyspepsia.11

  The diagnosis and management of patients with func-
tional dyspepsia poses a clinical challenge.

are watery diarrhoea with lower abdominal pain and
high fever. Leukocytosis (WBC >15 000/microL) is usually
a common clinical sign.

ficile toxins or detection of toxigenic C. difficile organ-

•	 EIA for C. difficile glutamate dehydro-genase
•	 Cell cytotoxicity assay and anaerobic culture

Treatment

The initial step in treating CDAD is cessation of the incit-
ing antibiotic. Treatment is indicated in patients who are
symptomatic and have a positive diagnostic test. Empiric
therapy can be administered pending the results of diag-
nostic testing if clinical suspicion is high. Treatment is not in-
dicated in asymptomatic patients with positive toxin assay.]]></page><page Index="104"><![CDATA[96 TREATMENT APPROACHES

Summary

The presence of albuminuria signifies a patient with silent
but modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease and
cardiovascular risk. All patients should undergo oppor-
tunistic dipstick-testing of their urine for detection of
overt albuminuria, and if positive, should have an ACR
and eGFR performed. Further investigation, manage-
ment and referral will depend on the level of ACR and
eGFR. Patients with high cardiovascular risk, signified by
the presence of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia,
smoking or overt cardiovascular disease, should under-
go an ACR for detection of micro-albuminuria to detect
a major additional risk factor for cardiovascular mortal-
ity, myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure, and
chronic kidney disease in diabetics. Aggressive cardio-
vascular risk protection should be undertaken.

Table 2. Criteria for major neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer’s disease (adapted from DSM-5)

 A.	 The criteria are met for major neurocognitive disorder.

 B.	 There is insidious onset and gradual progression of impairments.

 C.	 Criteria are met for either probable or possible Alzheimer’s disease.
 	 Probable Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed if either of the following is present (otherwise possible Alzheimer’s disease should

       be diagnosed):
             (1)	 Evidence of a causative Alzheimer’s disease genetic mutation from family history or genetic testing.
             (2)	 All three of the following are present:
                   a.	 Clear evidence of decline in memory and learning, and at least one other neurocognitive domain.
                   b.	Steadily progressive, gradual decline.
                   c.	 No evidence of mixed aetiology (ie, absence of other neurodegenerative or cerebrovascular disease, or
                          another neurological, mental or systemic disease likely to contribute to cognitive decline).

 D.	 The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a
       substance, or another mental, neurological or systemic disorder.

•	 Difficulty establishing a retrospective diagnosis of

    childhood ADHD
•	 When the clinician is unable to establish a clear

    DSM 5 diagnosis of ADHD
•	 Significant psychiatric comorbidity
•	 Contra-indications to stimulant use in the patient
•	 Failure of first-line treatment of adult ADHD

Conclusion

Although adult ADHD diagnosis and treatment may be
viewed with apprehension, this review aims to assist with
expanding the understanding of this disorder by prac-
titioners. Diagnosis should entail an extensive psychia-
tric work-up, including exploration of the developmen-
tal history, both a retrospective and current account
of ADHD symptoms and impairment, and associated
comorbidities, before initiating treatment. Information
should not only be gathered from the patient, but also
from reliable informants.4 It is important for general prac-
titioners to be able to recognise patients presenting with
adult ADHD to allow them to be able to treat and, if
necessary, refer accordingly.

less clinical improvement stops before maximum benefit
is obtained. When episodes are less than two-and-a-half
years apart, prophylactic treatment for five years is indi-
cated. Episodes that have involved significant suicidal
ideation or impairment of psychosocial functioning indi-
cate the need for prophylactic treatment.

  Medication and psychotherapy are often used in
combination. Some clinicians may view mood disorders
as fundamentally evolving from psychodynamic issues
and their ambivalence about the use of drugs may re-
sult in a poor response, non-compliance and probably
inadequate dosages for too short a time. Alternatively, if
clinicians ignore the psychosocial needs of a patient, the
outcome of pharmacotherapy may be compromised.

       excluded by a PCR test.

 Dysglycaemia5,11

 •	 Visceral fat gain, which occurs to a similar extent with all ART classes, is associated with insulin resistance.
 •	 Blood glucose should be assessed as part of a cardiovascular-risk assessment.

 Dyslipidaemia5,11

 •	 Associated with all classes. All PIs with the exception of unboosted ATV can cause fasting hypertriglyceridaemia and
       elevated LDL-cholesterol. d4T can cause mild hypertriglyceridaemia. EFV can cause elevated total cholesterol and mild
       hypertriglyceridaemia.

 •	 Indications for statin therapy in a HIV-infected patient should be the same as in an uninfected patient, but if the patient is
       receiving a PI, a switch to boosted ATV is a better option, rather than adding therapy for the dyslipidaemia. Switching the PI
       to RAL is another option, but only if used in a regimen with two other fully active drugs.

 •	 Statins have interactions with PIs that can lead to toxic concentrations, except pravastatin and fluvastatin. Atorvastatin
       concentrations are significantly raised by PIs, but lower doses of 10 mg daily may be used. Lovastatin and simvastatin should
       not be used as a severe rhabdomyolysis can occur.

 Gynaecomastia5,11

 •	 Bilateral or unilateral development of breast tissue in men.
 •	 Not related to lipodystrophy.
 •	 Associated with EFV, so patients should be switched to either NVP (only if CD4 <400), a PI or an InSTI

Table 2. Acute and chronic toxicities (continued)

 Hepatotoxicity5,13

 •	 Commonly associated with NNRTIs. In patients starting NVP, ALT should be monitored at two, four, eight and 12 weeks after
        initiation.

 •	 Mild ALT elevations can rarely occur with NRTIs and are usually transient. ALT elevations >5xULN are significant. Prolonged
        use of NRTIs, especially d4T, may cause fatty liver.

 •	 Isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is associated with ATV.
 •	 Patients with underlying hepatitis B or C infection frequently experience a “flare’”of hepatitis when ART is commenced, as

        a consequence of IRIS. Hepatitis B can also flare when drugs that have activity against hepatitis B (TDF, 3TC and FTC) are
        discontinued or when hepatitis B resistance develops.
 •	 Antituberculosis agents and azoles can cause hepatotoxicity.
 •	 Hepatotoxic drugs should be discontinued at high levels of LFT abnormality or at lower levels with symptoms of hepatitis.
        Patients must be assessed for features of hepatic failure.
 •	 In selected cases, re-challenge of drugs may be attempted, but under the supervision of a specialist.

 Hypersensitivity5

 •	 Rash with NNRTIs is common, especially with NVP. There is a cross-reaction between NVP and EFV.
 •	 If the rash is mild, the NNRTI can be continued and the rash treated symptomatically with antihistamines and topical ste-

        roids.
 •	 If accompanied by a fever, hepatitis, mucosal involvement or blistering, the NNRTI should be stopped immediately. Re-

        challenge of the drug should never be attempted.
 •	 ABC hypersensitivity occurs within the first eight weeks of use; therapy must be discontinued and never re-introduced.

 Hyperlactataemia syndromes5,11

 •	 Lactic acidosis is a fatal side effect mostly associated with d4T. Symptomatic hyperlactataemia without acidosis is more common.
 •	 Risk factors include female gender, obesity, and NRTIs use for >6 months, peripheral neuropathy and fatty liver disease.
 •	 Management depends on the lactate and bicarbonate concentrations:

        1.	 Lactate <5 mmol/L and minor symptoms: NRTIs should be switched to either TDF or ABC. Symptoms and serial lactate
              should be monitored until normal.

        2.	 Lactate >5 mmol/L and bicarbonate >15 mmol/L: NRTIs should be discontinued. Admit patient. Exclude other causes.
              Symptoms and serial lactate should be monitored until normal.

        3.	 Lactate >5mmol/L and bicarbonate <15 mmol/L: NRTIs should be discontinued. Refer for urgent specialist inpatient
              care. Sodium bicarbonate may be used to partially correct severe acidosis. Blood cultures should be drawn and
              broad-spectrum antibiotics can be used as sepsis can mimic NRTI-induced lactic acidosis. On recovery, all NRTIs must
              be avoided in all future regimens.

 Lipodystrophy5,11

 •	 Associated with long-term ART use.
 •	 Present with fat loss (lipoatrophy, presenting as facial-, limb- and buttock-wasting) or fat accumulation (visceral obesity,

        breast enlargement, buffalo hump or lipomata) or with both. Visceral fat accumulation is associated with insulin resistance
        and dyslipidaemia.
 •	 AZT and d4T associated with lipo-atrophy. PIs associated with lipohypertrophy.
 •	 The effects can be reversed, although this may be slow, or incomplete, with antiretroviral drug substitution, such as d4T/AZT
        with TDF or ABC.
 •	 Exercise or diet may reduce abdominal fat.
 •	 Metformin can reduce insulin resistance and cardiovascular-risk parameters, but the concurrent use of d4T may increase
        the risk of lactic acidosis.
 •	 Cosmetic surgery is an option for facial lipoatrophy or in those with prominent buffalo humps.

 Nephrotoxicity5,14

 •	 TDF can cause acute renal failure, and rarely a tubular wasting syndrome where patients may develop muscle weakness or
        other muscle symptoms. Potassium and phosphate levels must be checked.

 •	 In patients with comorbidities such as hypertension or diabetes, creatinine should also be checked at one and two months.
        Nephrotoxic agents, such as aminoglycosides or NSAIDs, should generally be avoided.

 •	 In renal failure, TDF must be stopped. With all NRTIs except ABC, the dose needs to be adjusted according to GFR.

 Neuropsychiatric toxicity5,15

 •	 Neuropsychiatric effects, such as insomnia, vivid dreams and dizziness, are commonly associated with EFV in the first few
        weeks of therapy, and subside within the first four to six weeks. Psychosis may occasionally occur. EFV neurotoxicity may
        manifest as a pancerebellar syndrome and is more common in women with a low BMI; concomitant use of isoniazid is a risk
        factor. EFV levels should be drawn and refer to a specialist.

 •	 If not tolerated, then the patient should be switched to NVP (only consider if CD4 <250 in women and CD4 <400 in men) or LPV/r.
 •	 Insomnia and headache, in addition to weight gain, are known side effects of DTG
 •	 Peripheral neuropathy is commonly associated with the use of d4T, although other causes should be excluded. Pain control

        and assistance with the activities of daily living are the mainstay of therapy. Some patients may require a switch in their an-
        tiretroviral therapy. For milder forms of pain, NSAIDs may be prescribed. Antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, can be used.
        Anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin and carbamazepine, are also effective in reducing pain.

Immune reconstitution
inflammatory syndrome

The clinical syndromes of Immune reconstitution inflam-
matory syndrome (IRIS) are of two types. A paradoxical
IRIS occurs when paradoxical worsening of symptoms or
new manifestations of a known condition, typically an
infection, present upon immune recovery. An unmask-
ing IRIS occurs when diseases not previously suspected,
become apparent after initiation of ART. Managing
such patients can be difficult. Treatment includes path-
ogen-specific therapy and anti-inflammatory therapies,
such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
or corticosteroids.5,6,12

Infectious diseases are a significant problem in the re-     from infected to susceptible hosts by certain species of
turning traveller and range from potentially life-threat-
ening diseases, such as malaria, to those that are more
common and may be less threatening, such as travel-
ler’s diarrhoea. For the majority of patients, the consid-
eration in combination with the detailed travel history,
dates of travel in relation to the onset of symptoms,
presentation of the major symptom complex, findings of
a thorough examination and a few key laboratory in-
vestigations, can rapidly clinch the diagnosis or at least
logically guide further investigation.

  The physician should be aware of the incubation pe-
riods of various diseases, the geographic distribution of
the disease along with current outbreaks, and be famil-
iar with the major symptom complex of most common
travel-related infections. Mode of travel, exposures to
insects, unsafe food and/or water, unpasteurised dairy,
raw fish, animal bites and licks, fresh water bodies, caves
and sexual encounters are important considerations.
Pre-travel immunisation, comorbidities, and medica-
tions may affect occurrence and disease presentation.

   The risk of contracting malaria is highest in Africa and
Oceania, followed by Asia and Latin America. Plasmo-
dium falciparum is the most prevalent species in Africa
and overall the most serious, with rapid progression to
complicated disease. The diagnosis and management
of malaria in travellers is urgent and should be consid-
ered in any traveller returning from a malaria-transmis-
sion area who presents with an acute febrile illness, ir-
respective of whether chemoprophylaxis was taken or
the season. The physician should focus initially on those

Important practice points
•	 Confirming a diagnosis before treatment is ideal, but must be balanced against the need to treat severe illness
•	 The origin of the infection may be unrelated to recent travel and consideration must always be given to alternative local

    sources
•	 Full blood count; blood-smear examination, especially for malaria; and liver function tests are obligatory initial investigations
•	 Fever and eosinophilia are commonly due to acute schistosomiasis (Katayama fever)
•	 Skin lesions are important clues to many travel-related infections, e.g. African tick-bite fever (see Figure 1), East African trypa-

    nosomiasis (see Figure 2), arboviruses (see Figure 3)
•	 Tick-bite fever is common in travellers in Africa, and the typical rash may be absent. Doxycycline treatment is highly effective.
•	 Fever, rash, myalgia and arthritis are suggestive of arboviral infections.

include worsening abdominal pain, vomiting, tender

increased hematocrit, decreased platelet levels, and

and reverts spontaneously to normal during the two
to three days of the recovery phase, which is cate-
gorised by rapid improvement in the patient’s symp-
toms, with the occasional exception of fatigue which
can persist for a few weeks. The period of viraemia
or infectiousness starts approximately three days after
an infectious mosquito bite, about two days before
the onset of symptoms and lasts around six to seven
days in total, including about five days after the onset
of symptoms. The rash is an important manifestation
of dengue and is variable, depending on the stage
of the illness.

  Several types of skin rashes have been described. Ini-
tially, diffuse flushing, mottling or fleeting pinpoint erup-
tions may be observed on the face, neck and chest
(see Figure 5). These are transient. The second type of
skin rash is a conspicuous rash that may be maculo-
papular or scarlatiniform and appears on approxi-
mately the third or fourth day. Towards the end of the
febrile period or immediately after defervescence, the
generalised rash fades, and there is a confluent pe-
techial rash characterised by a scattered pale, round
area of normal skin (see Figure 6). There may be itching
and peeling.]]></page><page Index="142"><![CDATA[134 TRETARETAMTEMNETNATPAPPRPORAOCAHCEHS ES

Therefore, clinical treatment remains confined to fluid
therapy to support critical organ function, as presently
there are no antiviral medications to treat or prevent
dengue infections. Fluid therapy should seek to replace
the minimum fluid necessary to stabilise and maintain
cardiovascular function, whether through oral rehydra-
tion in mild cases, isotonic solutions in more severe cas-
es, or even blood transfusions in extreme cases, as each
risk the development of fluid overload.

Prevention

Prevention of dengue in travellers focuses on the use
of effective insecticide repellents applied to exposed
areas of skin to prevent the daytime biting by Aedes
mosquitos.

  CYD-TDV is the first dengue vaccine to be licensed,
initially in Mexico 2015, for use in individuals 9-45 years
of age living in endemic areas, and it is now licensed in
20 countries. CYD-TDV is a live recombinant tetravalent
dengue vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur (CYD-
TDV), given as a three-dose series on a 0/6/12-month
schedule. The vaccine is not recommended for travel-
lers, but rather for countries considering vaccination as
part of their dengue-control programme. In this case,
a “pre-vaccination screening strategy” would be the
preferred option, in which only dengue-seropositive
persons are vaccinated.

Table 1. Essential clinical practice points on malaria diagnosis

  •	 The diagnosis of malaria is a medical emergency
  •	 Malaria cannot be diagnosed or excluded on clinical grounds.
  •	 Urgent testing by RDT or laboratory methods is mandatory in any patient with a febrile illness compatible with malaria, with

       or without an appropriate travel history.
  •	 This is irrespective of the time of the year and history of chemoprophylaxis use.
  •	 Prophylaxis and antibiotic use may prolong the incubation period and suppress the malaria parasite level below the

       detectable limit.
  •	 A negative malaria test does not exclude the diagnosis.
  •	 If malaria is suspected, tests should be repeated at appropriate intervals (12-24 hours) without attempting to coincide with

       fever peak timing, until a positive result is reported or an alternative diagnosis is made.
  •	 If the patient is critically ill, empiric treatment may be warranted while laboratory confirmation is awaited.
  •	 Personally follow up results actively and do not assume they will automatically reach you.
  •	 Quantitation of P. falciparum parasite load, as an indication of severity or of response to treatment, should be routinely

       reported as part of the microscopic smear examination.
  •	 Rapid antigen tests may occasionally give false-positive or false-negative results; stained smear examination should be done

       as well when possible, especially if clinical suspicion of malaria is high.
  •	 Do not request PCR alone for primary diagnosis, particularly if the patient is very ill, as it may take days to get the result;

       standard microscopy or RDTs are much quicker.
  •	 Malaria must be considered in any person with unexplained fever and progressive illness. Odyssean malaria or “axi malaria”

       is an uncommon phenomenon, but has a high mortality, given the delays in diagnosis. Thrombocytopaenia is a common
       laboratory finding even in uncomplicated malaria and must always prompt an examination of the blood for malaria
       parasites in patients with unexplained fever.

Table 4. Post-exposure prevention of rabies in humans

Prevention of rabies in humans

Rabies exposure risk assessment
      •	 A risk assessment is essential to determine if the animal exposure carries a risk of rabies transmission and therefore
             whether rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is necessary
      •	 This assessment is based on geographical area, animal species, the behaviour of the animal, and the health of the
             animal
      •	 Indicators of high-risk rabies incidence include:
             o	 Unprovoked animal attack: Please note: Teasing an animal, trying to take an animal’s food or a guard dog
                  attacking an unfamiliar person entering their territory, are provoked attacks
             o	 An animal with abnormal behaviour – e.g. domestic animals being unusually aggressive without being provoked;
                  wild animals appearing “tame”.
             o	 Animal appearing sick – drooling, wobbling/unsteady gait, snapping at imaginary objects
             o	 Animal having died soon after the human attack or within two weeks of the human attack
      •	 If the incident suggests any of the above, then give rabies PEP if the category of exposure is 2 or 1 – see below

Notes     All animal bites are reportable as per district requirements
      •	  There is NO blood test to confirm or exclude rabies virus transmission from animal to human at the time of exposure
      •	  The vaccination history of an animal may be unreliable, and as such, should be treated with caution and be given
      •	  least weight in the risk assessment
          Do not delay PEP pending test results for the animal
      •	  If the responsible veterinarian later confirms the animal is rabies- free, then PEP can be discontinued
      •	  PEP is most effective if given immediately after the exposure
      •	  Do not withhold PEP when there is a delay in the patient presenting to a health facility
      •	  If PEP is given, Day 0 is the date the first rabies vaccine dose is given
      •	

Management of patients exposed to potentially rabid animal

General wound management is critical in all patients:
      •	 Flush very well with soap and water or water alone if soap is not available, for 5-10 minutes, then clean with 70% alcohol
             solution
      •	 After cleaning, apply iodine solution or ointment if available
      •	 Give antibiotics, e.g. amoxicillin clavulanate, when indicated
      •	 Give tetanus vaccination or booster. Avoid suturing, compressing wound and use of local anaesthetic agents, if
             possible

Further specific management depends on the category of rabies exposure and previous vaccination history:
      •	 Vaccine course in category 2 and 1 exposure*
      •	 Addition of rabies immunoglobulin in category 1 exposures is critical**
      •	 If a patient has had three or more rabies vaccines in the past, then give two booster doses on days 0 and 1 post
             exposure

Categories of exposure

Category Description                                         Action

1 •	 Touching or feeding the animal                          •	 No action if the history of exposure is reliable
                   •	 Licking intact skin                    •	 If the history of exposure is not reliable, treat as

                                                                   category 2

2 •	 Nibbling of uncovered skin                              •	 General wound management as above, plus

          •	 Superficial scratch without any bleeding        •	 Give a full course of rabies vaccine*

3 •	 Bites or scratches penetrating skin or •	 General wound management as above, plus

                        drawing even a drop of blood         •	 Give a full course of vaccine*

          •	 Licking of mucous membranes, such as            •	 Give rabies immunoglobulin**

despite this, no effect on mortality was seen. There was
no significant difference in rates of serious infection or
neoplasm between the two groups. It must be noted
that important subgroups of patients were excluded in
this trial – amongst others, patients with hepatitis B co-
infection, those with pericardial or rifampicin-resistant
TB, those on non-standard TB regimens, those with Ka-
posi sarcoma and those with uncontrolled diabetes.
Also, only adults were enrolled. Thus, the extrapolation
of these generalised results to routine clinical practice
may be somewhat limited. Nonetheless, the trial does
suggest that prednisone may safely prevent TB IRIS in
many HIV patients commencing ART, provided the pa-
tient has been carefully evaluated for any contra-indi-
cating conditions beforehand.

Figure 4. The modified 2016 fibromyalgia criteria

A patient satisfies modified 2016 fibromyalgia criteria if the following 3 conditions are met:
(1) Widespread pain index (WPI) >7 and symptom severity scale (SSS) score >5 OR WPI of 4-6 and SSS score >9.
(2) Generalised pain, defined as pain in at least 4 of 5 regions, must be present. Jaw, chest and abdominal pain are not

     included in generalised pain definition.
(3) Symptoms have been generally present for at least 3 months.
(4) A diagnosis of fibromyalgia is valid irrespective of other diagnoses. A diagnosis of fibromyalgia does not exclude the

     presence of other clinically important illnesses.

Ascertainment
(1) WPI: Note the number of areas in which the patient has had pain over the last week. In how many areas has the patient had

     pain? Score will be between 0 and 19

(2) Symptom severity scale (SSS)

Fatigue
Waking unrefreshed
Cognitive symptoms
For each of the 3 symptoms above, indicate the level of severity over the past week using the following scale:
0 = No problem
1 = Slight or mild problems, generally mild or intermittent
2 = Moderate, considerable problems, often present and/or at a moderate level
3 = Severe: pervasive, continuous, life-disturbing problems
The symptom severity scale (SSS) score: is the sum of the severity scores of the 3 symptoms (fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and
cognitive symptoms) (0-9) plus the sum (0-3) of the number of the following symptoms the patient has been bothered by that
occurred during the previous 6 months:
(1) Headaches (0-1)
(2) Pain or cramps in lower abdomen (0-1)
(3) And depression (0-1)

The final symptom severity score is between 0 and 12
The fibromyalgia severity (FS) scale is the sum of the WPI and SSS

Step 1: Entry criterion: The criteria below can only be used for patients presenting with at least one episode of swelling or tenderness
in a peripheral joint or bursa.
Step 2: The presence of monosodium urate crystals in a symptomatic joint or bursa (synovial fluid) or the presence of tophus: If this
clinical criterion is present, the classification of gout can be made without using Step 3.

When to refer

General practitioners and internal medicine specialists
often manage gout. Referral to a rheumatologist be-
comes necessary in the following situations:
•	 Failure to reach disease control with first-line therapy.
•	 Severe side effects on standard therapy.
•	 Severe tophaceous gout with the risk of functional

    loss of joints, e.g. tendon rupture and loss of hand
    function.

Doses shown are the maximum recommended daily dose. Doses greater than those recommended for each indication have either not demonstrated additional efficacy or have not been
studied. As the cardiovascular risks of EXINEF may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily dose should be used.

SELECTED SAFETY INFORMATION: CONTRAINDICATIONS: EXINEF is contraindicated in: patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of EXINEF; patients with active peptic ulceration or gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding; patients with severe hepatic dysfunction (Child-Pugh score > 9 or serum albumin < 25 g/l); patients with estimated creatinine clearance

< 30 ml/min; patients who have developed signs of asthma, acute rhinitis, nasal polyps, angioedema or urticaria following the administration of aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including EXINEF; hypertension which has not been adequately controlled; pregnancy and lactation; children and adolescents under 16 years of age; patients with

inﬂammatory bowel disease; patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA II - IV); established ischaemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease and/or cerebrovascular disease; perioperative analgesia in the setting of coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG). WARNINGS AND SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: EXINEF may predispose to cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal

events or cutaneous reactions which may be fatal. Long-term administration of NSAIDs such as EXINEF has resulted in renal papillary necrosis and other renal injury. Under conditions of compromised renal perfusion, administration of EXINEF may cause a reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood ﬂow and thereby impair renal function. Caution

should be used when initiating treatment with EXINEF in patients with dehydration. Fluid retention, oedema and hypertension have been observed in patients taking EXINEF. All NSAIDs, including EXINEF, can be associated with new onset or recurrent congestive cardiac failure. Special attention should be paid to blood pressure monitoring during treatment with EXINEF.

Clinical trials suggest that the selective COX-2 inhibitor class of medicines such as EXINEF are associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events (especially myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke). As the cardiovascular risks of selective COX-2 inhibitors may increase with dose and duration of exposure, the shortest duration possible and the lowest effective daily

dose should be used. Patients with signiﬁcant risk factors for cardiovascular events (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) should only be treated with EXINEF after careful consideration. EXINEF is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis because of its lack of effect on platelets. When using EXINEF in the elderly and in

patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac dysfunction, medically appropriate supervision should be intensiﬁed. If these patients deteriorate during treatment, appropriate measures should be taken, including discontinuation of EXINEF. Upper GI complications, some of them resulting in fatal outcome, have occurred in patients treated with EXINEF. There is an increase in the

risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects when EXINEF is taken concomitantly with aspirin (even at low doses). Elevations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1 % of patients in clinical trials treated for up to one year with EXINEF 60 and

90 mg daily. EXINEF may mask fever and other signs of inﬂammation or infection. EXINEF Tablets contain lactose. Patients with hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deﬁciency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take EXINEF. The use of EXINEF is not recommended in fertile women attempting to conceive. SIDE EFFECTS: In

clinical studies, the undesirable effects proﬁle was similar in patients with OA or RA treated with EXINEF for one year or longer. Very common (≥ 1/10) and Common (≥ 1/100, < 1/10) reported effects: alveolar osteitis, oedema/ﬂuid retention, dizziness, headache, palpitations, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders (e.g. abdominal pain, ﬂatulence, heartburn), diarrhoea,

dyspepsia, epigastric discomfort, nausea, ecchymosis, asthenia/fatigue, ﬂu-like disease, increased ALT, AST.  EXINEF® 30 Tablet is not marketed.

INDICATIONS: CELESTONE® SOLUSPAN® is indicated in the treatment of severe or acute rheumatic, dermatologic and allergic conditions. CONTRAINDICATIONS: CELESTONE® SOLUSPAN® Injection is contraindicated in patients with systemic fungal infections, in patients hypersensitive to betamethasone
sodium phosphate, betamethasone acetate, other corticosteroids, or to any component of this product. Not for use in conditions ordinarily considered contraindicated to corticosteroid therapy. The anticipated clinical improvement must be weighed against the possibility of undesirable corticosteroid effects.
The safety in pregnancy and lactation has not been established. WARNINGS AND SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: CELESTONE® SOLUSPAN® Injection is not for intravenous or subcutaneous use. Serious neurologic events, some resulting in death, have been reported with epidural injection of corticosteroids.
Speciﬁc events reported include, but are not limited to, spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness and stroke. Rare instances of anaphylactoid/anaphylactic reactions with a possibility of shock have occurred in patients receiving parenteral corticosteroid therapy. Strict aseptic technique
is mandatory in the use of CELESTONE® SOLUSPAN® Injection. Dosage adjustments may be required with remission or exacerbation of the disease process, the patient’s individual response to therapy and exposure of the patient to emotional or physical stress such as serious infection, surgery or injury.
Corticosteroids may mask some signs of infection, and new infections may appear during use. When corticosteroids are used, decreased resistance and inability to localise infection may occur. Prolonged corticosteroid use may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts (especially in children), glaucoma with

possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Average and large doses of corticosteroids can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention and increased excretion of potassium. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on

corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunisation procedures should not be undertaken in patients receiving corticosteroids, especially high doses. However, immunisation procedures may be undertaken in patients who are receiving corticosteroids as replacement

therapy e.g. for Addison’s disease. Exposure to chickenpox and measles should be avoided in patients especially children, on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids. Use in active tuberculosis is restricted to fulminating or disseminated TB in conjunction with an appropriate anti-TB regimen. Reactivation
of disease may occur in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment; when dosage reduction is possible, it should be gradual. The effects of CELESTONE® SOLUSPAN® are enhanced in patients with
hypothyroidism or in those with cirrhosis. Psychic derangements may appear with corticosteroid therapy. CELESTONE® SOLUSPAN® should be used with caution in ocular herpes simplex, non-speciﬁc ulcerative colitis, abscess or other pyogenic infection, diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or
latent peptic ulcer, renal insufﬁciency, hypertension, osteoporosis and myasthenia gravis. SIDE EFFECTS: Fluid and electrolyte disturbances: Sodium retention, potassium loss, hypokalaemic alkalosis, ﬂuid retention, congestive heart failure in susceptible patients, hypertension. Musculoskeletal: Muscle
weakness, corticosteroid myopathy, loss of muscle mass, aggravation of myasthenic symptoms in myasthenia gravis, osteoporosis, vertebral compression fractures, aseptic necrosis of femoral and humeral heads, pathologic fracture of long bones, tendon rupture, joint instability (from repeated intra-articular
injections). Gastrointestinal: Hiccups, peptic ulcer with possible subsequent perforation and haemorrhage, pancreatitis, abdominal distention, ulcerative oesophagitis. Dermatologic: Impaired wound healing, skin atrophy, thin fragile skin, petechiae and ecchymoses, facial erythema, increased sweating,
suppressed reactions to skin tests, reactions such as allergic dermatitis, urticaria, angioneurotic oedema. Neurologic: Convulsions, increased intracranial pressure with papilloedema (pseudotumor cerebri) usually after treatment, vertigo, headache. Endocrine: Menstrual irregularities, development of
Cushingoid state, suppression of foetal intrauterine or childhood growth, secondary adrenocortical and pituitary unresponsiveness, particularly in times of stress, as in trauma, surgery or illness, decreased carbohydrate tolerance, manifestations of latent diabetes mellitus, increased requirements of insulin
or oral hypoglycaemic agents in diabetes. Ophthalmic: Posterior subcapsular cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, exophthalmos, vision blurred. Metabolic: Negative nitrogen balance due to protein catabolism. Psychiatric: Euphoria, mood swings, severe depression to frank psychotic
manifestations, personality changes, insomnia. Other: Anaphylactoid or hypersensitivity and hypotensive or shock-like reactions.

Gradual visual loss in the elderly can be due to:
•	 Cataract formation
•	 Glaucoma
•	 “Dry”/atrophic AMD
•	 Diabetic retinopathy and/or maculopathy
•	 Masquerading syndromes
•	 Tuberculosis of the eye
•	 Opportunistic infections associated with AIDS

  The three most common causes of decreased vision
in the elderly are cataracts, glaucoma and AMD (wet
and dry). This article discusses these conditions in more
detail.

Cataracts

A cataract is clouding of the normally clear lens of the
eyes, causing vision to become blurred. The lens is po-
sitioned behind the coloured iris. It focuses light rays on
the retina. With ageing, the lens becomes thicker, less]]></page><page Index="196"><![CDATA[188 TREATMENT APPROACHES

  Since AMD patients typically develop the dry form
first, wet AMD occurs on a background of dry AMD; as
such, dry AMD can be considered a risk factor or even
precursor state for wet AMD. Significant overlap exists
in the underlying mechanisms of dry and wet AMD. In
spite of that, treatment of wet AMD does not prevent
deterioration of dry AMD in the same eye.

is another important cause of visual loss in the elderly.
With advanced disease, the patient has a microscopic
residual field of vision, which ultimately will be lost en-
tirely if no treatment is received.

  Treatment of glaucoma is mostly with the daily ad-
ministering of drops to lower IOP. Since drops are very
effective owing to improved newer products on the
market, laser treatment or surgery is needed much less
frequently today than in the past. Treatment has to be
continued for life. Elderly patients may have difficulty to
administer drops or remember to do so, and will need
help from family or friends.

  Visual acuity, IOP measurement, assessment of optic
disc-cupping and visual field assessment are needed
regularly to ensure the disease is optimally controlled,
and there is no further visual loss. Follow-up once stable
is usually once or twice a year.

the majority resolve, 10-30% persist into adulthood.4

Impact on society

Atopic dermatitis is associated with significant morbidity
and can profoundly impact quality of life (QOL). The lack
of sleep from relentless pruritus affects both patient and
caregiver, as well as functioning at school and work.

Pathophysiology

Atopic dermatitis is a chronic multifactorial disease, result-
ing from a dysfunctional skin barrier and immune respons-
es that are influenced by genetic and environmental fac-
tors. A strong family history of atopy and loss of function
mutations in the filaggrin gene have been strongly asso-
ciated with atopic dermatitis development. Other asso-
ciated genes include claudin-1 (CLDN1) and serine pro-
tease inhibitor Kazal-Type (SPINK5). Immune responses in
atopic dermatitis are characterised by an increase in TH2
and TH17 responses.

  Botulinum toxin is to be reconstituted only with 0.9%
sterile, non-preserved saline (100 units in 2.5 ml saline)
before intramuscular injection. Do not exceed the rec-
ommended dosage and frequency of administration of
botulinum toxin. Botulinum toxin is supplied in 100-unit
and 50-unit vials. Other diluents, including lidocaine,
should not be used for reconstitution. (Refer to the
package instructions of the product.)

  Wrinkle classification for botulinum toxin treatment:
•	 Dynamic wrinkles are wrinkles only present with facial

    expressions or movement and are ideal for botulinum
    toxin therapy.
•	 Resting or static wrinkles are present with or without
    movement and usually necessitate combination
    therapy.
