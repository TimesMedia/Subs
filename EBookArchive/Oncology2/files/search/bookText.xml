Table 1. FIGO staging of ovarian cancer

Stage I – Tumour is confined to the ovary/ovaries

Ia Only one ovary is affected by the tumour, the ovary capsule is intact
         No tumour is detected on the surface of the ovary
         Malignant cells are not detected in ascites or peritoneal washings

Ib Both ovaries are affected by the tumour, the ovary capsule is intact
         No tumour is detected on the surface of the ovaries
         Malignant cells are not detected in ascites or peritoneal washings

Ic The tumour is limited to one or both ovaries, with any of the following:
         The ovary capsule is ruptured
         The tumour is detected on the ovary surface
         Positive malignant cells are detected in the ascites or peritoneal washings

Stage II – Tumour involves one or both ovaries and has extended into the pelvis.

IIa The tumour has extended and/or implanted into the uterus and/or the fallopian
         tubes
         Malignant cells are not detected in ascites or peritoneal washings

IIb The tumour has extended to another organ in the pelvis
         Malignant cells are not detected in ascites or peritoneal washings

IIc Tumours are as defined in IIa/b, and malignant cells are detected in the ascites
         or peritoneal washings

Stage III – The tumour involves one or both ovaries with microscopically confirmed
peritoneal metastasis outside the pelvis and/or regional lymph-node metastasis.
Includes liver capsule metastasis.

IIIa Microscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond the pelvis

IIIb Microscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond the pelvis, 2 cm or less in greatest
         dimension

IIIc Microscopic peritoneal metastasis beyond the pelvis, more than 2 cm in greatest
         dimension and/or regional lymph nodes metastasis

Stage: IV – Distant metastasis beyond the peritoneal cavity and liver parenchymal
metastasis.

myeloma and smouldering multiple myeloma

 Definition of multiple myeloma

 Clonal bone-marrow plasma cells ≥10% of biopsy-proven bony or extramedullary
 plasmacytoma* and any one or more of the following myeloma-defining events:

 Evidence of end-organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma-cell
 proliferative disorder, specifically:
 Hypercalcaemia: serum calcium >0.25 mmol/L (>1 mg/dL) higher than the upper limit
 of normal or >2.75 mmol/L (>11 mg/dL)
 Renal insufficiency: creatinine clearance <40 ml per min¶ or serum creatinine
 >177 µmol/L (>2 mg/dL)
 Anaemia: haemoglobin value of >2 g/dL below the lower limit of normal, or a
 haemoglobin value <10 g/dL
 Bone lesions: one or more osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET-CTΔ

 Any one or more of the following biomarkers of malignancy:
 Clonal bone-marrow plasma cell percentage* ≥60%
 Involved: uninvolved serum-free light-chain ratio◊ ≥100
 >1 focal lesions on MRI studies§

 Definition of smouldering multiple myeloma

 Both criteria must be met:
 Serum monoclonal protein (IgG or IgA) ≥30 g/L or urinary monoclonal protein ≥500 mg
 per 24 hours and/or clonal bone-marrow plasma cells 10 to 60%
 Absence of myeloma-defining events or amyloidosis

 Definition of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance

 All three criteria must be met:
 Serum monoclonal protein <30 g/L
 Bone-marrow plasma cells <10%
 Absence of myeloma-defining events or amyloidosis (or Waldenström
 macroglobulinemia in the case of IgM MGUS)

PET-CT: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography.
* Clonality should be established by showing kappa/lambda-light-chain restriction on flow
cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or immunofluorescence. Bone-marrow plasma cell percentage
should preferably be estimated from a core biopsy specimen; in case of a disparity between the
aspirate and core biopsy, the highest value should be used.
¶ Measured or estimated by validated equations.
Δ If bone marrow has less than 10% clonal plasma cells, more than one bone lesion is required to
distinguish from solitary plasmacytoma with minimal marrow involvement.
◊ These values are based on the serum Freelite assay (The Binding Site Group, Birmingham, UK). The
involved free light chain must be ≥100 mg/L.
§ Each focal lesion must be 5 mm or more in size.

n	  Urine analysis
Findings on urine analysis depend on the
cause of kidney damage. Myeloma cast
nephropathy is characterised by casts
formed from precipitated monoclonal light
chains in the distal tubule which may be
sloughed off and seen on microscopy. The
urine dipsticks are often negative for pro-
tein despite a raised urine protein: creati-
nine ratio, because the protein detected is
Bence-Jones protein (i.e., light chains) and
the dipstick is sensitive only for albumin. In
LCCD and amyloidosis AL, the dipsticks
will be positive as these conditions cause
albuminuria. Thus, for accurate urine light-
chain (Bence Jones proteinuria) testing
and quantification, a 24-hour urine sample
for urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) and
immunofixation is ideally required. Howev-
er, due to the cumbersome collection and
testing method, this test has largely been
superseded in clinical utility by the serum
free light-chain (FLC) assay.

* The Northern Ireland Cancer Network states that neutropaenic sepsis is a “time-dependent” condition, the
successful management of which is dependent upon the early recognition of the likelihood that the cancer
patient’s problem represents a neutropaenic fever/sepsis syndrome1. Since more than 70 percent of cancer
treatment-related syndromes, including neutropaenic fever, manifest within four to six weeks of systemic
treatment2, the Northern Ireland Cancer Network has recommended a history of chemotherapy within the past
six weeks as a sensitive discriminator to detect patients with neutropaenic fever/sepsis syndromes by triage
services in health-care facilities1.

¶ SIRS is a clinical syndrome that is a form of dysregulated inflammation. The term SIRS has routinely been
associated with both infectious processes (sepsis) and noninfectious insults, such as an autoimmune disorder,
pancreatitis, vasculitis, thrombo-embolism, burns, or surgery. SIRS was previously defined as two or more
abnormalities in temperature, heart rate, respiration, or white blood cell count.3 However, in practice, its clinical
definition and pathophysiology are nonequivocal such that SIRS and early sepsis cannot be readily distinguished.
Thus, when SIRS is suspected it should prompt an evaluation for a septic focus.

Δ Hypoperfusion is defined by hypotension persisting after initial fluid challenge or blood lactate concentration
≥4 mmol/L.4 Refer to the UpToDate topic review on the definition of sepsis and SIRS for additional details.

◊ Goal-directed therapy for initial resuscitation includes the following: (a) central venous pressure 8 to 12
mmHg; (b) mean arterial pressure ≥65 mmHg; (c) urine output ≥0.5 mL/kg per hour; and (d) central venous
(superior vena cava) oxygen saturation ≥70 percent or mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥65 percent.4 Refer to
the UpToDate topic review on evaluation and management of sepsis for additional details.

§ Sepsis is defined as the presence (probable or documented) of infection together with systemic
manifestations of infection (eg, temperature >38.3 or <36°C, heart rate >90 beats/min, respiratory rate >20
breaths/min, altered mental status, leukocytosis, arterial hypotension, arterial hypoxaemia).4 Refer to the
UpToDate topic review on the definition of sepsis and SIRS for the full diagnostic criteria for sepsis.

¥ Patients at low risk for serious complications are defined as those who are expected to be neutropaenic
(absolute neutrophil count [ANC] <500 cells/microL) for ≤7 days and those with no comorbidities or evidence
of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction. High-risk patients are defined as those who are expected to be
neutropaenic (ANC <500 cells/microL) for >7 days; patients with neutropaenic fever who have ongoing
comorbidities or evidence of significant hepatic or renal dysfunction are also considered to be high risk,
regardless of the duration of neutropaenia. The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer
(MASCC) risk index can also be used for determining risk. A MASCC score of ≥21 predicts a low risk for medical
complications of neutropaenic fever syndromes that would require hospitalisation and/or prolonged length of
hospitalisation. A score of <21 predicts patients at high risk for such complications.5 Refer to the text for more
details regarding the definitions of low- and high-risk patients based upon clinical criteria and the MASCC risk
score.

Achieve and maintain a healthy weight
If overweight or obese, limit consumption of energy-dense foods and beverages and
increase physical activity to promote weight loss

Engage in regular physical activity
Avoid inactivity and return to normal daily activities as soon as possible after diagnosis.
Aim to exercise at least 150 minutes per week.
Include strength-training exercises at least two days per week.

Achieve a dietary pattern that is high in vegetables, fruit and whole grains
Follow the American Cancer Society Guidelines on Nutrition and Physical Activity for
Cancer Prevention; i.e., limit consumption of processed meat and red meat; eat at
least 2.5 cups of vegetables and fruit daily; choose whole grains instead of refined
grain products; and, if you drink alcoholic beverages, limit consumption to no more

         Ibrutinib
          Ibrutinib is a small-molecule inhibitor of BTK
          as it forms covalent bonds with a cysteine
          residue in the BTK active site, inhibiting en-
          zyme activity.140 BTK is a signalling molecule
          of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) and
          cytokine receptor pathways. Ibrutinib in-
          hibits malignant B-cell proliferation, survival,
