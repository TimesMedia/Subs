A.	 Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days
     than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work
     or school performance).

B.	 T he individual finds it difficult to control the worry.

     not for the past 6 months):

       Note: Only one item is required in children.

       1.	 R estlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.

             sleep).

D.	 T he anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or
     impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

E.	 The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
     (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition
     (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

F.	 T he disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or
     worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social
     anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-
     compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety

Note: Total score for the 7 items ranges from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cut-offs for

severity measure for GAD, the GAD-7 also has moderately good operating characteristics for panic
disorder, social anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. When screening for anxiety
disorders, a recommended cut-off for further evaluation is a score of 10 or greater.

 A.	 R ecurrent unexpected panic attacks. A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense
      fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which
      time four (or more) of the following symptoms occur:

      Note: The abrupt surge can occur from a calm state or an anxious state.

      1.	 Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate.

      2.	 Sweating.

      3.	 Trembling or shaking.

      4.	 S ensations of shortness of breath or smothering.

      5.	 F eelings of choking.

      6.	 C hest pain or discomfort.

      7.	 Nausea or abdominal distress.

      8.	 Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint.

      9.	 Chills or heat sensations.

      10.	 Paraesthesias (numbness or tingling sensations).

      11.	 Derealisation (feelings of unreality) or depersonalisation (being detached from
            oneself).

      12.	 F ear of losing control or “going crazy”.

      13.	 Fear of dying.

      Note: Culture-specific symptoms (e.g., tinnitus, neck soreness, headache,
      uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen. Such symptoms should not count
      as one of the four required symptoms.

 B.	 At least one of the attacks has been followed by one month (or more) of one or
      both of the following:

      1.	 P ersistent concern or worry about additional panic attacks or their
            consequences (e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, “going crazy”).

      2.	 A significant maladaptive change in behaviour related to the attacks
            (e.g., behaviours designed to avoid having panic attacks, such as avoidance
            of exercise or unfamiliar situations).

 C.	 The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance
      (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition
      (e.g., hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary disorders).

 D.	 The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., the panic

‡ Not FDA-approved for PD, although there is some evidence to support its use; approved for GAD.
§ Consideration of mono-amine oxidase inhibitors should prompt referral to psychiatry.
|| Benzodiazepines may be used for augmentation during acute treatment. Dependence,
tolerance, and escalating doses to get the same effect over the long term can be problematic with
use of benzodiazepines. Short-term prescribing with emphasis on acute management of uncon-
trolled anxiety is preferred. Slowly tapered dosing can prevent rebound symptoms.
¶ Short-acting benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam, are not preferred because they have a higher
risk of addiction and adverse effects.
** Not FDA-approved for GAD, although there is some evidence to support its use; approved for PD.

Intervention Comments

Cognitive     This intervention is useful in treating anxiety disorders. The cognitive
behaviour     portion assists change in thinking patterns that support fears, whereas
therapy*      the behaviour portion often involves training patients to relax deeply
              and helps desensitise patients to anxiety-provoking triggers.

              To be effective, therapy must be directed at the patient’s specific
              anxieties and tailored to his or her needs. There are minimal adverse
              effects, except that behaviour desensitisation is typically associated
              with temporary, mild increases in anxiety.33

Mindfulness-  This intervention promotes focused attention on the present,
based stress  acknowledgment of one’s emotional state, and meditation for further

              Key features include moment-to-moment awareness cultivated with a
              non-judgmental attitude, formal meditation techniques, and daily
              practice.34

Note: Formal use of these interventions requires specialised training. In patients whose anxiety and
impairment are severe, referral to a trained behaviour health specialist should be considered.
