     SELECTED SAFETY INFORMATION
     COZAAR  50  I  COZAAR  100
          ®
                    ®
     INDICATIONS: Hypertension: COZAAR ®  is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. Renal protection in Type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension and proteinuria. CONTRA-
     INDICATIONS: COZAAR ®  is contra-indicated in patients: who are hypersensitive to any component of this product; with a history of angio-oedema related to ACE inhibitors or
     angiotensin receptor antagonists such as COZAAR ® ; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; COZAAR ®  is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or for
     patients with hepatic impairment; aortic stenosis, left ventricular outﬂ ow track obstruction; bilateral renal artery stenosis; renal artery stenosis in patients with a single kidney;
     concomitant therapy with potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene and amiloride;  pregnancy and lactation. Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness
     in children have not been established. WARNINGS: Should a woman become pregnant while receiving COZAAR ® , the treatment must be stopped promptly and changed to
     a different medicine. If a woman is contemplating pregnancy, a different class of medicine should be used. Serum potassium levels should be monitored regularly. SPECIAL
     PRECAUTIONS: Hypersensitivity: Angio-oedema. Hypotension and electrolyte/ﬂ uid imbalance: In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with high-
     dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. These conditions should be corrected prior to administration of COZAAR ® , or a lower starting dose should be used. Electrolyte
     imbalances are common in patients with renal impairment, with or without diabetes, and should be addressed. In a clinical study conducted in type 2 diabetic patients with
     proteinuria, the incidence of hyperkalaemia was higher in the group treated with COZAAR ®  as compared to the placebo group; however, few patients discontinued therapy due
     to hyperkalaemia. Liver function impairment: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate signiﬁ cantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients,
     a dose of 25 mg should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Renal function impairment: When impaired renal function is present, changes in renal
     function as a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, including renal failure, have been reported in susceptible individuals; in some patients these changes in renal
     function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients
     with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (less frequently)
     with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been reported with COZAAR ® . Agents that affect the renin-angiotensin system may increase blood urea and serum
     creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with COZAAR ® ; these changes in renal function
     may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Porphyria: Limited information is available regarding the effect of antihypertensive medication in patients with porphyria. Safety
     of losartan in patients with porphyria has not been fully established. Use in the elderly: In clinical studies there was no age-related difference in efﬁ cacy or safety proﬁ le of losartan.
     Excipient: COZAAR ®  contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deﬁ ciency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not
     take COZAAR ® . SIDE EFFECTS: In controlled clinical trials for essential hypertension, the following very common (≥ 1/10) and common (≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10) adverse experiences were
     reported, regardless of drug relationship: upper respiratory infection, insomnia, headache, dizziness, vertigo, palpitation, tachycardia, cough, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, sinus
     disorder, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, back pain, muscle cramps, asthenia/fatigue, oedema/swelling, chest pain, hyperkalaemia and elevations of ALT. The
     following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience; they are derived from spontaneous reports for which precise incidences cannot be determined,
     therefore the frequency is unknown: anaemia, anaphylactic reactions, angio-oedema including swelling of the larynx and glottis causing airway obstruction and/or swelling
     of the face, lips, pharynx and/or tongue has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan; some of these patients previously experienced angio-oedema with ACE
     inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, migraine, dysgeusia, erectile dysfunction/impotence, vasculitis, including Henoch-Schönlein purpura, cough, hepatitis, urticaria, pruritis,
     erythroderma, photosensitivity, myalgia, arthralgia, liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia (reported rarely), vomiting and malaise.
     COZAAR  COMP 50/12,5  I  COZAAR  COMP 100/12,5
          ®
                            ®
     INDICATIONS: COZAAR ®  COMP is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients established on identical doses of the individual medicines. CONTRA-INDICATIONS: COZAAR ®
     COMP should not be used in the following conditions: hypersensitivity  to any of the components of COZAAR ®  COMP; a history of angioedema related to previous therapy with
     ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); hereditary or idiopathic angioedema; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM); severe renal function impairment
     (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min); bilateral renal artery stenosis; renal artery stenosis in patients with a single kidney; aortic stenosis; concomitant therapy with potassium
     sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride;  porphyria; pregnancy; lactation and in hepatic impairment. Hydrochlorothiazide in combination with COZAAR ®
     COMP should not be given to patients with Addison’s disease. COZAAR ®  COMP is also contra-indicated in patients with anuria, and hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived
     medicines. Lithium therapy: Concomitant administration with COZAAR ®  COMP may lead to toxic blood concentrations of lithium. The concomitant use of COZAAR ®  COMP with
     aliskiren-containing products is contra-indicated. WARNINGS AND SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: Should a woman become pregnant while receiving COZAAR ®  COMP, the treatment
     should be stopped promptly and switched to a different class of antihypertensive medicine. As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, changes in renal function
     including renal failure have been reported. (These changes in renal function may not be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy). COZAAR ®  COMP may increase blood
     urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Concomitant use of drugs that may cause hyperkalaemia. In
     patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. These conditions should be corrected prior
     to administration of COZAAR ®  COMP or a lower starting dose should be used. (Periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals). Thiazide
     therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic agents, including insulin, may be required. Hydrochlorothiazide as in COZAAR ®  COMP may decrease
     urinary calcium excretion and may cause an elevation of serum calcium. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of occult hyperparathyroidism. COZAAR ®  COMP should be
     discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function). Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with hydrochlorothiazide therapy. COZAAR ®
     COMP may precipitate hyperuricaemia and/or gout in certain patients. Concomitant administration of lithium with COZAAR ®  COMP may lead to toxic blood concentrations of
     lithium. In patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide as in COZAAR ®  COMP hypersensitivity reactions may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Exacerbation
     or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazides. Safety and efﬁ cacy in children has not been established.  There is evidence that the
     concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren may increase the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decrease renal function (including acute renal failure). Excipient:
     COZAAR ®  COMP contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deﬁ ciency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not
     take COZAAR ®  COMP. SIDE EFFECTS: In controlled clinical trials for essential hypertension, the following very common (≥ 1/10), and common (≥ 1/100, &lt; 1/10) adverse experiences
     were reported in patients treated with COZAAR ®  COMP: Dizziness and asthenia/fatigue. With Losartan potassium: Insomnia, headache, dizziness, palpitation, tachycardia, cough,
     pharyngitis, nasal congestion, sinus disorder, upper respiratory infection, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, back pain, muscle cramps, asthenia/fatigue, oedema/
     swelling, chest pain , hyperkalaemia and elevations of ALT. With Hydrochlorothiazide:  The adverse events reported with hydrochlorothiazide were uncommon (≥ 1/1 000, &lt; 1/100);
     rare (≥ 1/10 000, &lt; 1/1 000) or very rare (&lt; 1/10 000).
     FORTZAAR ®
     INDICATIONS: FORTZAAR ®  is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients established on identical doses of the individual agents. CONTRA-INDICATIONS: FORTZAAR ®  should
     not be used in the following conditions: sensitivity to any of the components of FORTZAAR ® , a history of angioedema related to previous therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin
     receptor blockers (ARBs), hereditary or idiopathic angioedema, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), severe renal function impairment (creatinine clearance less
     than 30ml/min), bilateral renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis in patients with a single kidney, aortic stenosis, concomitant therapy with potassium sparing diuretics such as
     spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride; porphyria, pregnancy, lactation and hepatic impairment. Thiazide diuretics in (ﬁ xed dose) combination as with FORTZAAR ®  should not
     be given to patients with Addison’s disease. This therapy is also contra-indicated in patients with severe renal impairment or anuria, and in patients who show hypersensitivity to
     other sulphonamide-derived medicines. Concomitant administration with FORTZAAR ®  may lead to toxic blood concentrations of lithium. Safety and efﬁ cacy in children has not
     been established. WARNINGS: Hypotension and electrolyte/ﬂ uid imbalance: In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics),
     symptomatic hypotension may occur. These conditions should be corrected prior to administration of FORTZAAR ® , or a lower starting dose should be used.  (Periodic determination
     of serum electrolytes must be performed at appropriate intervals). Metabolic and endocrine effects: Hydrochlorothiazide, a component of FORTZAAR ® , therapy may impair glucose
     tolerance. Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic agents, including insulin, may be required. Hydrochlorothiazide, a component of FORTZAAR ® , may decrease urinary calcium excretion
     and may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. FORTZAAR ®  should be discontinued
     before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with hydrochlorothiazide, a component of FORTZAAR ® ,
     therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide, a component of FORTZAAR ® , therapy may precipitate hyperuricaemia and/or gout in certain patients. Concomitant use with lithium: Concomitant
     administration of lithium with FORTZAAR ®  may lead to toxic blood concentrations of lithium. SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: Hepatic and renal impairment:  FORTZAAR ®  is not recommended
     for patients with hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment. As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, changes in renal function including renal failure
     have been reported. These changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. FORTZAAR ®  may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients
     with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan. Other: In patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide, a
     component of FORTZAAR ® , hypersensitivity reactions may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus
     has been reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide, as contained in FORTZAAR ® . Excipient: FORTZAAR ®  contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose
     intolerance, the Lapp lactase deﬁ ciency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take FORTZAAR ® . SIDE EFFECTS: In controlled clinical trials for essential hypertension, the
     following very common (≥1/10) and common (≥ 1/100, &lt;1/10) adverse experiences were reported in patients treated with FORTZAAR ® : dizziness and asthenia/fatigue. With Losartan:
     Upper respiratory infection, insomnia, headache, dizziness, palpitation, tachycardia, cough, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, sinus disorder, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain,
     dyspepsia, back pain, muscle cramps, asthenia/fatigue, oedema/swelling, chest pain, hyperkalaemia and elevations of ALT. With Hydrochlorothiazide: The adverse events reported
     with hydrochlorothiazide were uncommon (≥ 1/1 000, &lt; 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000, &lt; 1/1 000) or very rare (&lt; 1/10 000). The following clinical trials side effects have been reported with the
     use of either losartan or hydrochlorothiazide but the frequencies are unknown: sialadenitis, aplastic anaemia, electrolyte imbalance including hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia,
     restlessness, xanthopsia, transient blurred vision, vertigo, hypotension and/or postural hypotension, gastric irritation, purpura, cramping, muscle spasm, renal dysfunction, interstitial
     nephritis, renal failure, fever and weakness.
     AMZAAR  5/50  I  AMZAAR  5/100
                      ®
          ®
     CONTRAINDICATIONS: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of AMZAAR ® ; A history of angioedema related to previous therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
     blockers (ARBs). These patients must never again be given these medicines; Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema; Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM); Severe
     renal function impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min); Bilateral renal artery stenosis; Renal artery stenosis in patients with a single kidney; Aortic stenosis; Concomitant
     therapy with potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride; Porphyria; Lithium therapy: Concomitant administration with AMZAAR ®  may lead to toxic
     blood concentrations of lithium; Pregnancy and lactation; Concomitant administration with renin antagonists such as aliskiren; Hepatic impairment.  WARNINGS AND SPECIAL
     PRECAUTIONS: Should a woman become pregnant while receiving AMZAAR ®  the treatment should be stopped promptly and switched to a different class of antihypertensive
     medicine. There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or renin antagonists such as aliskiren may increase the risk of
     hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreases renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of AMZAAR ®  and aliskiren is therefore
     contraindicated. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Intravascular volume depletion
     should be corrected prior to administration of AMZAAR ® . Electrolyte imbalances are common in patients with renal impairment, with or without diabetes and should be addressed.
     Concomitant use of other medicines that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia. As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, deterioration of
     renal function including renal failure have been reported in susceptible individuals. Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the
     dose of AMZAAR ®  due to the amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. SIDE EFFECTS: Common treatment-related adverse events include
          MIMS ConCISe GuIde to CardIovaSCular, MetabolIC and endoCrIne dISeaSeS  VOLUME 1
     dizziness and headache, asthenia/fatigue, vertigo, hypotension and hyperkalaemia.</code></pre>
