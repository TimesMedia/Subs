 CONTRAINDICATIONS: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of AMZAAR ® ; A history of angioedema related to previous therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
 blockers (ARBs). These patients must never again be given these medicines; Hereditary or idiopathic angioedema; Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM); Severe
 renal function impairment (creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min); Bilateral renal artery stenosis; Renal artery stenosis in patients with a single kidney; Aortic stenosis; Concomitant
 therapy with potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride; Porphyria; Lithium therapy: Concomitant administration with AMZAAR ®  may lead to toxic
 blood concentrations of lithium; Pregnancy and lactation; Concomitant administration with renin antagonists such as aliskiren; Hepatic impairment.  WARNINGS AND SPECIAL
 PRECAUTIONS: Should a woman become pregnant while receiving AMZAAR ®  the treatment should be stopped promptly and switched to a different class of antihypertensive
 medicine. There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or renin antagonists such as aliskiren may increase the risk of
 hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreases renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of AMZAAR ®  and aliskiren is therefore
 contraindicated. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Intravascular volume depletion
 should be corrected prior to administration of AMZAAR ® . Electrolyte imbalances are common in patients with renal impairment, with or without diabetes and should be addressed.
 Concomitant use of other medicines that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia. As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, deterioration of
 renal function including renal failure have been reported in susceptible individuals. Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the
 dose of AMZAAR ®  due to the amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. SIDE EFFECTS: Common treatment-related adverse events include
 dizziness and headache, asthenia/fatigue, vertigo, hypotension and hyperkalaemia.  MIMS ConCISe GuIde to CardIovaSCular, MetabolIC and endoCrIne dISeaSeS  VOLUME 1</code></pre>
