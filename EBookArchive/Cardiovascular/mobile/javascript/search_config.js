What is Reaptan ®  indicated for: Reaptan ®  is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients already stabilised with perindopril and         amlodipine at equivalent dosages. Treatment of hypertension in patients uncontrolled on either perindopril or amlodipine monotherapy. Do not use Reaptan ®  in case of:* • Hypersensitivity         to the active substances, or to any other ACE-inhibitor or to dihydropyridines derivatives, or to any of the excipients, • Hereditary /idiopathic angioedema, history of angioedema associated         with previous ACE-inhibitor therapy, • Second and third trimesters of pregnancy, • Concomitant use of Reaptan ®  with aliskiren-containing products in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal         impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min/1,73 m), • Severe hypotension, shock, including cardiogenic shock, • Obstruction of the outﬂ ow-tract of the left ventricle (e.g. high grade aortic stenosis), •         Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction. • Concomitant use with sacubitril/valsartan. #   • Extracorporeal treatments leading to contact of blood with         negatively charged surfaces. #  • Signiﬁ cant bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney.  #  • Porphyria. What are the important identiﬁ ed risks and         the main undesirable effects that may occur with Reaptan ® ?* Hypersensitivity/Angioedema: • Angioedema of the face, extremities, lips, mucous membranes, tongue, glottis and/or         larynx has been reported rarely in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril. • In such cases: discontinue Reaptan ® , initiate and continue appropriate monitoring until complete         resolution of symptoms has occurred. In those instances where swelling was conﬁ ned to the face and lips the condition generally resolved without treatment, although antihistamines have         been useful in relieving symptoms. • Angioedema associated with laryngeal oedema may be fatal. • Where there is involvement of the tongue, glottis or larynx, likely to cause airway         obstruction, emergency therapy should be administered promptly. This may include the administration of adrenaline and/or the maintenance of a patent airway. • Patients with a history of         angioedema unrelated to ACE-inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk of angioedema while receiving an ACE-inhibitor. • Intestinal angioedema has rarely been reported. Patients presented         with abdominal pain (with or without nausea and vomiting): in some cases there was not prior facial engioedema and C-1 esterase levels were normal. • Due to increased risk of angioedema,         sacubitril/valsartan must not be initiated until 36 hours after taking the last dose of perindopril therapy. Perindopril therapy must not be started until 36 hours after the last dose of sacubitril/         valsartan. Concomitant use of other NEP inhibitors (e.g. racecadotril) and ACE-inhibitos may also increase the risk of angioedema.  #  • Concomitant use of mTOR inhibitors may be at increased         risk for angioedema. • Frequency: uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100). Neutropenia/Agranulocytosis/Thrombocytopenia: • Perindopril should be used with extreme caution in patients         with collagen vascular disease, immunosuppressant therapy, treatment with allopurinol or procainamide, or a combination of these complicating factors, especially if there is pre-existing         impaired renal function. If perindopril is used in such patients, periodic monitoring of white blood cell counts is advised and patients should be instructed to report any sign of infection (e.g.         sore throat, fever). • Frequency: very rare (< 1/10 000). Hypotension: • More likely to occur in patients who have been volume-depleted (e.g. by diuretic therapy, dietary salt restriction,         dialysis, diarrhoea or vomiting) or who have severe renin-dependent hypertension. • In patients at high risk of symptomatic hypotension, with ischaemic heart or cerebrovascular disease, blood         pressure, renal function and serum potassium should be monitored closely. • Frequency: common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10). Hyperkalaemia: • Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia:         renal insufﬁ ciency, worsening of renal function, age (> 70 years), diabetes mellitus, intercurrent events, in particular dehydratation, acute cardiac decompensation, metabolic acidosis, and         concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements or potassium containing salt substitutes; or other drugs associated with increases in serum potassium (e.g. heparin,         co-trimoxazole also known as trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole).  #  • If concomitant use of perindopril and any of the above mentioned agents is deemed appropriate, they should be used with         caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. • Frequency: uncommon (not known (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/10). The other common undesirable effects of Reaptan ®  are somnolence,         dizziness, headache (especially at the beginning of treatment), dysgeusia, paraesthesia, visual disturbances (including diplopia), tinnitus, vertigo, palpitations, ﬂ ushing, dyspnoea, cough,         abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, change in bowel habits, diarrhoea, constipation, pruritis, rash, exanthema, joint swelling (ankle swelling), muscle spasms, fatigue and asthenia.         What are the other warnings or precautions associated with the use of Reaptan ® ?* • Anaphylactoid reaction during - low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis with dextran sulphate:         rarely, patients have experienced life threatening anaphylactoid reactions, temporarily withhold treatment prior to exams. - desensitisation treatment (e.g. Hymenoptera venom): Temporarily         withhold treatment prior to exams. These reactions reappeared upon inadvertent rechallenge. • Renovascular hypertension: increased risk of hypotension and renal insufﬁ ciency when patient         with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a single functioning kidney are treated with ACE-inhibitors Diuretics may be a contributory factor. Loss of renal function may occur         (minor changes in serum creatinine) even in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis.  #  • Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS): concomitant use of ACE-         inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers or aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS is         therefore not recommended. ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy. • Primary aldosteronism: use not         recommended in patients with primary hyperaldosteronism (not responding medication acting through inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system).  #  • Pregnancy: ACE-inhibitors should not         be initiated during pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, stop treatment with ACE-inhibitors immediately and, if appropriate, start alternative therapy. • Mitral valve stenosis/obstruction         in the outﬂ ow of the left ventricle (e.g. aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), cardiac failure: use with caution.• Renal impairment: monitor potassium and creatinine; individual dose         titration with the monocomponents recommended if Clcr < 60 ml/min. In patients with renal artery stenosis, blood urea and creatinine may increase; with renovascular hypertension, risk of         severe hypotension and renal insufﬁ ciency. Renal failure: amlodipine is not dialysable. • Hepatic failure: rarely, ACE-inhibitors have been associated with a syndrome that starts with cholestatic         jaundice and progresses to fulminant hepatic necrosis and (sometimes) death. Stop treatment if jaundice or marked elevations of hepatic enzymes. Impaired hepatic function: slow dose         titration and careful monitoring if severe hepatic impairment. • Black people: ACE-inhibitors may be less effective and cause a higher rate of angioedema than in non-black. • Cough: non-         productive. • Surgery/Anaesthesia: stop treatment one day prior to surgery. • Diabetic patients: monitor glycaemia during ﬁ rst month. • Hypertensive crisis: safety and efﬁ cacy of amlodipine         has not been established. • Elderly patients: dosage increase with care. • Galactose intolerance/glucose-galactose malabsorption/Lapp lactase deﬁ ciency: should not be taken. • Lithium/         Potassium-sparing medicines/Potassium supplements/Dantrolene: not recommended.  # Pending         References: Bahl V, et al.

We spend hours trying to figure out whether CovId-19 is a           respiratory infection or vascular disease, whether chloroquine or dexamethasone represents           a wonder cure, whether asymptomatic positive people can or cannot transmit the virus. With           the constantly evolving knowledge about this single disease entity that is dominating our           lives, and frequent updates on its prevention, diagnosis and treatment, it becomes easy to be           distracted. this distraction is further compounded by the restriction of movement during the           lockdown, by the fear of patients and doctors alike.             MIMS Concise Guide to Cardiovascular, Metabolic and Endocrine Diseases aims to provide the           busy clinician with a concise update on important, relevant clinical issues. It will save you time,           but still provide you with the latest guidelines from the experts.             the first semester of the year presented the profession with the challenge of how to           continue to serve individuals and communities in the best possible way, given the realities           of CovId-19. In those presenting with respiratory disease which in the differential diagnosis           could include CovId-19, focus has been not only on the illness, but also on the patient with           physical, mental and emotional issues now further complicated by uncertainties around           finances and job security, or loneliness. the challenges posed by CovId-19 have created an           opportunity to re-think and re-imagine how we can better serve our patients – not only right           now, but also going forward. therefore this edition of the MIMS Concise Guide to Cardiovascular,           Metabolic and Endocrine Diseases also touches on the use of technology, with terminology like           digital devices, home monitoring and artificial intelligence, that will become part of clinical           practice and will hopefully contribute to increased access to, and better outcomes of, care.           as clinicians, we need to imagine how to better serve all the people of our beautiful country,           given our resource constraints.             We trust that you will enjoy MIMS Concise Guide to Cardiovascular, Metabolic and Endocrine           Diseases.

Renal protection in Type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension and proteinuria. CONTRA-      INDICATIONS: COZAAR ®  is contra-indicated in patients: who are hypersensitive to any component of this product; with a history of angio-oedema related to ACE inhibitors or      angiotensin receptor antagonists such as COZAAR ® ; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy; COZAAR ®  is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment or for      patients with hepatic impairment; aortic stenosis, left ventricular outﬂ ow track obstruction; bilateral renal artery stenosis; renal artery stenosis in patients with a single kidney;      concomitant therapy with potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene and amiloride;  pregnancy and lactation. Paediatric use: Safety and effectiveness      in children have not been established. WARNINGS: Should a woman become pregnant while receiving COZAAR ® , the treatment must be stopped promptly and changed to      a different medicine. If a woman is contemplating pregnancy, a different class of medicine should be used. Serum potassium levels should be monitored regularly. SPECIAL      PRECAUTIONS: Hypersensitivity: Angio-oedema. Hypotension and electrolyte/ﬂ uid imbalance: In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with high-      dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. These conditions should be corrected prior to administration of COZAAR ® , or a lower starting dose should be used. Electrolyte      imbalances are common in patients with renal impairment, with or without diabetes, and should be addressed. In a clinical study conducted in type 2 diabetic patients with      proteinuria, the incidence of hyperkalaemia was higher in the group treated with COZAAR ®  as compared to the placebo group; however, few patients discontinued therapy due      to hyperkalaemia. Liver function impairment: Based on pharmacokinetic data which demonstrate signiﬁ cantly increased plasma concentrations of losartan in cirrhotic patients,      a dose of 25 mg should be considered for patients with a history of hepatic impairment. Renal function impairment: When impaired renal function is present, changes in renal      function as a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, including renal failure, have been reported in susceptible individuals; in some patients these changes in renal      function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. In patients whose renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (e.g. patients      with severe congestive heart failure), treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors has been associated with oliguria and/or progressive azotemia and (less frequently)      with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been reported with COZAAR ® . Agents that affect the renin-angiotensin system may increase blood urea and serum      creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with COZAAR ® ; these changes in renal function      may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. Porphyria: Limited information is available regarding the effect of antihypertensive medication in patients with porphyria. Safety      of losartan in patients with porphyria has not been fully established. Use in the elderly: In clinical studies there was no age-related difference in efﬁ cacy or safety proﬁ le of losartan.      Excipient: COZAAR ®  contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deﬁ ciency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not      take COZAAR ® . SIDE EFFECTS: In controlled clinical trials for essential hypertension, the following very common (≥ 1/10) and common (≥ 1/100, < 1/10) adverse experiences were      reported, regardless of drug relationship: upper respiratory infection, insomnia, headache, dizziness, vertigo, palpitation, tachycardia, cough, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, sinus      disorder, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, back pain, muscle cramps, asthenia/fatigue, oedema/swelling, chest pain, hyperkalaemia and elevations of ALT. The      following adverse reactions have been reported in post-marketing experience; they are derived from spontaneous reports for which precise incidences cannot be determined,      therefore the frequency is unknown: anaemia, anaphylactic reactions, angio-oedema including swelling of the larynx and glottis causing airway obstruction and/or swelling      of the face, lips, pharynx and/or tongue has been reported rarely in patients treated with losartan; some of these patients previously experienced angio-oedema with ACE      inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, migraine, dysgeusia, erectile dysfunction/impotence, vasculitis, including Henoch-Schönlein purpura, cough, hepatitis, urticaria, pruritis,      erythroderma, photosensitivity, myalgia, arthralgia, liver function abnormalities, thrombocytopenia (reported rarely), vomiting and malaise.

CONTRA-INDICATIONS: COZAAR ®      COMP should not be used in the following conditions: hypersensitivity  to any of the components of COZAAR ®  COMP; a history of angioedema related to previous therapy with      ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs); hereditary or idiopathic angioedema; hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM); severe renal function impairment      (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min); bilateral renal artery stenosis; renal artery stenosis in patients with a single kidney; aortic stenosis; concomitant therapy with potassium      sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride;  porphyria; pregnancy; lactation and in hepatic impairment. Hydrochlorothiazide in combination with COZAAR ®      COMP should not be given to patients with Addison’s disease. COZAAR ®  COMP is also contra-indicated in patients with anuria, and hypersensitivity to other sulphonamide-derived      medicines. Lithium therapy: Concomitant administration with COZAAR ®  COMP may lead to toxic blood concentrations of lithium. The concomitant use of COZAAR ®  COMP with      aliskiren-containing products is contra-indicated. WARNINGS AND SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: Should a woman become pregnant while receiving COZAAR ®  COMP, the treatment      should be stopped promptly and switched to a different class of antihypertensive medicine. As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, changes in renal function      including renal failure have been reported. (These changes in renal function may not be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy). COZAAR ®  COMP may increase blood      urea and serum creatinine in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Concomitant use of drugs that may cause hyperkalaemia. In      patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. These conditions should be corrected prior      to administration of COZAAR ®  COMP or a lower starting dose should be used. (Periodic determination of serum electrolytes should be performed at appropriate intervals). Thiazide      therapy may impair glucose tolerance. Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic agents, including insulin, may be required. Hydrochlorothiazide as in COZAAR ®  COMP may decrease      urinary calcium excretion and may cause an elevation of serum calcium. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of occult hyperparathyroidism. COZAAR ®  COMP should be      discontinued before carrying out tests for parathyroid function). Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with hydrochlorothiazide therapy. COZAAR ®      COMP may precipitate hyperuricaemia and/or gout in certain patients. Concomitant administration of lithium with COZAAR ®  COMP may lead to toxic blood concentrations of      lithium. In patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide as in COZAAR ®  COMP hypersensitivity reactions may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Exacerbation      or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus has been reported with the use of thiazides. Safety and efﬁ cacy in children has not been established.  There is evidence that the      concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren may increase the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decrease renal function (including acute renal failure). Excipient:      COZAAR ®  COMP contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deﬁ ciency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not      take COZAAR ®  COMP. SIDE EFFECTS: In controlled clinical trials for essential hypertension, the following very common (≥ 1/10), and common (≥ 1/100, < 1/10) adverse experiences      were reported in patients treated with COZAAR ®  COMP: Dizziness and asthenia/fatigue. With Losartan potassium: Insomnia, headache, dizziness, palpitation, tachycardia, cough,      pharyngitis, nasal congestion, sinus disorder, upper respiratory infection, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, back pain, muscle cramps, asthenia/fatigue, oedema/      swelling, chest pain , hyperkalaemia and elevations of ALT. With Hydrochlorothiazide:  The adverse events reported with hydrochlorothiazide were uncommon (≥ 1/1 000, < 1/100);      rare (≥ 1/10 000, < 1/1 000) or very rare (< 1/10 000).      FORTZAAR ®      INDICATIONS: FORTZAAR ®  is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in patients established on identical doses of the individual agents. CONTRA-INDICATIONS: FORTZAAR ®  should      not be used in the following conditions: sensitivity to any of the components of FORTZAAR ® , a history of angioedema related to previous therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin      receptor blockers (ARBs), hereditary or idiopathic angioedema, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), severe renal function impairment (creatinine clearance less      than 30ml/min), bilateral renal artery stenosis, renal artery stenosis in patients with a single kidney, aortic stenosis, concomitant therapy with potassium sparing diuretics such as      spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride; porphyria, pregnancy, lactation and hepatic impairment. Thiazide diuretics in (ﬁ xed dose) combination as with FORTZAAR ®  should not      be given to patients with Addison’s disease. This therapy is also contra-indicated in patients with severe renal impairment or anuria, and in patients who show hypersensitivity to      other sulphonamide-derived medicines. Concomitant administration with FORTZAAR ®  may lead to toxic blood concentrations of lithium. Safety and efﬁ cacy in children has not      been established. WARNINGS: Hypotension and electrolyte/ﬂ uid imbalance: In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with high-dose diuretics),      symptomatic hypotension may occur. These conditions should be corrected prior to administration of FORTZAAR ® , or a lower starting dose should be used.  (Periodic determination      of serum electrolytes must be performed at appropriate intervals). Metabolic and endocrine effects: Hydrochlorothiazide, a component of FORTZAAR ® , therapy may impair glucose      tolerance. Dosage adjustment of antidiabetic agents, including insulin, may be required. Hydrochlorothiazide, a component of FORTZAAR ® , may decrease urinary calcium excretion      and may cause intermittent and slight elevation of serum calcium. Marked hypercalcaemia may be evidence of hidden hyperparathyroidism. FORTZAAR ®  should be discontinued      before carrying out tests for parathyroid function. Increases in cholesterol and triglyceride levels may be associated with hydrochlorothiazide, a component of FORTZAAR ® ,      therapy. Hydrochlorothiazide, a component of FORTZAAR ® , therapy may precipitate hyperuricaemia and/or gout in certain patients. Concomitant use with lithium: Concomitant      administration of lithium with FORTZAAR ®  may lead to toxic blood concentrations of lithium. SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS: Hepatic and renal impairment:  FORTZAAR ®  is not recommended      for patients with hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment. As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, changes in renal function including renal failure      have been reported. These changes in renal function may be reversible upon discontinuation of therapy. FORTZAAR ®  may increase blood urea and serum creatinine in patients      with bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis of the artery to a solitary kidney. Similar effects have been reported with losartan. Other: In patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide, a      component of FORTZAAR ® , hypersensitivity reactions may occur with or without a history of allergy or bronchial asthma. Exacerbation or activation of systemic lupus erythematosus      has been reported with the use of hydrochlorothiazide, as contained in FORTZAAR ® . Excipient: FORTZAAR ®  contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose      intolerance, the Lapp lactase deﬁ ciency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take FORTZAAR ® . SIDE EFFECTS: In controlled clinical trials for essential hypertension, the      following very common (≥1/10) and common (≥ 1/100, <1/10) adverse experiences were reported in patients treated with FORTZAAR ® : dizziness and asthenia/fatigue. With Losartan:      Upper respiratory infection, insomnia, headache, dizziness, palpitation, tachycardia, cough, pharyngitis, nasal congestion, sinus disorder, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain,      dyspepsia, back pain, muscle cramps, asthenia/fatigue, oedema/swelling, chest pain, hyperkalaemia and elevations of ALT. With Hydrochlorothiazide: The adverse events reported      with hydrochlorothiazide were uncommon (≥ 1/1 000, < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000, < 1/1 000) or very rare (< 1/10 000). The following clinical trials side effects have been reported with the      use of either losartan or hydrochlorothiazide but the frequencies are unknown: sialadenitis, aplastic anaemia, electrolyte imbalance including hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia,      restlessness, xanthopsia, transient blurred vision, vertigo, hypotension and/or postural hypotension, gastric irritation, purpura, cramping, muscle spasm, renal dysfunction, interstitial      nephritis, renal failure, fever and weakness.

WARNINGS AND SPECIAL      PRECAUTIONS: Should a woman become pregnant while receiving AMZAAR ®  the treatment should be stopped promptly and switched to a different class of antihypertensive      medicine. There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or renin antagonists such as aliskiren may increase the risk of      hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreases renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of AMZAAR ®  and aliskiren is therefore      contraindicated. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Intravascular volume depletion      should be corrected prior to administration of AMZAAR ® . Electrolyte imbalances are common in patients with renal impairment, with or without diabetes and should be addressed.      Concomitant use of other medicines that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia. As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, deterioration of      renal function including renal failure have been reported in susceptible individuals. Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the      dose of AMZAAR ®  due to the amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease.

AMZAAR  5/50  I  AMZAAR  5/100  ®  ®  CONTRAINDICATIONS: Hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of AMZAAR ® ; A history of angioedema related to previous therapy with ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor  blockers (ARBs).

WARNINGS AND SPECIAL  PRECAUTIONS: Should a woman become pregnant while receiving AMZAAR ®  the treatment should be stopped promptly and switched to a different class of antihypertensive  medicine. There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) or renin antagonists such as aliskiren may increase the risk of  hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreases renal function (including acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of AMZAAR ®  and aliskiren is therefore  contraindicated. In patients who are intravascularly volume-depleted (e.g. those treated with diuretics), symptomatic hypotension may occur. Intravascular volume depletion  should be corrected prior to administration of AMZAAR ® . Electrolyte imbalances are common in patients with renal impairment, with or without diabetes and should be addressed.  Concomitant use of other medicines that may increase serum potassium may lead to hyperkalemia. As a consequence of inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, deterioration of  renal function including renal failure have been reported in susceptible individuals. Worsening angina and acute myocardial infarction can develop after starting or increasing the  dose of AMZAAR ®  due to the amlodipine, particularly in patients with severe obstructive coronary artery disease. SIDE EFFECTS: Common treatment-related adverse events include  dizziness and headache, asthenia/fatigue, vertigo, hypotension and hyperkalaemia.
